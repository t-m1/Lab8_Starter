Since graceful degradation is great for applications, but needs help in resilience, performance, and a11y, we can use service workers to help add these to the application. For example, service workers are able to receive network requests, even when you are offline, which makes them resilient due to the fact that they don't need to rely on the internet and the many problems that network connection can create. Also, this can help with performance since service workers have multithreaded programming.
